# My Favorite Apps

## Objective
This project is aimed at practicing Data Structures and Algorithms with an iOS app. The main goal of this project is to help users track their search keys and save them in history.

## Covers
### Stack
**Core logic: ios-track-search-key/Model/StackDS/KeyWordStackManager.swift**

Insert at front: 0(1)

Remove last: O(1)

Remove (having index): O(1)

Searching key: O(n)

### Double Linked List
**Core logic: ios-track-search-key/Model/DoubleLinkedListDS/KeyWordDLLManager.swift**

Insert at front: 0(1)

Remove last: O(1)

Find and remove node: O(n)

Forming array for display: O(n)

### Comparing
Each node in a doubly linked list stores two pointers (next and prev), increasing memory overhead.
A stack, typically implemented using an array, has lower memory usage as it does not need pointers(in this case).

## How to run the app locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kisari/ios-track-search-key.git
```

## Run the project
